Valid time intervals depend on the [`MetricKind`](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time. When writing data points, the start time must not be more than 25 hours in the past and the end time must not be more than five minutes in the future.
//
// * For `GAUGE` metrics, the `startTime` value is technically optional; if
//   no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the
//   end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both
//   start and end times are specified, they must be identical. Such an

//   measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a
//   millisecond after the end time of the previous interval.

//   non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and
//   non-overlapping intervals. For `DELTA` metrics, the start time of
//   the next interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time
//   of the previous interval.

// * For `CUMULATIVE` metrics, the start time and end time must specify a
//   a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same
//   start time and increasing end times, until an event resets the
//   cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the following
//   points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the
//   end time of the previous interval.
//
// * The start time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the
//   end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed. If the

// Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of
// the data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time
// series in the set is _aligned_ to the same time interval boundaries, then the
// set of time series is optionally _reduced_ in number.
//
// Alignment consists of applying the `per_series_aligner` operation
// to each time series after its data has been divided into regular
// `alignment_period` time intervals. This process takes _all_ of the data
// points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as
// averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single
// data point per period.
//
// Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be
// combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
// transformations. Reduction involves applying a `cross_series_reducer` to
// all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
// `group_by_fields`, and applying the reducer to each subset.
//
// The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from
// multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into
// a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the
// 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This
// representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the
// individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more
// details, see [Filtering and
// aggregation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/aggregation).

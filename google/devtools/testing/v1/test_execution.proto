// Each test execution will wait for available capacity. It will then be
// invoked as described. The test may be invoked multiple times if an

// the test will be stored in an external storage system.
//
// The TestExecutionService models this behavior using two resource types:
//
// - TestMatrix: a group of one or more TestExecutions, built by taking a
//   product of values over a pre-defined set of axes. In the case of Android
//   Tests, for example, device model and OS version are two axes of the matrix.
//
// - TestExecution: a single execution of one or more test targets on a
//   single device. These are created automatically when a TestMatrix is
//   created.
//
// This service returns any error codes from the canonical error space (i.e.
// google.rpc.Code). The errors which may be returned are specified on each
// method. In addition, any method may return UNAVAILABLE or INTERNAL.

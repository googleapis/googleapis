  summary: |-
    Stop. This folder is likely not what you are looking for.

    This folder contains protocol buffer definitions for an unreleased API for
    accessing Cloud Storage. Unless told otherwise by a Google Cloud
    representative, do not use any of the contents of this folder. If you
    would like to use Cloud Storage, please consult our [official
    documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/apis) for details on
    our XML and JSON APIs, or else consider one of our
    [client
    libraries](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries).

    This API defined in this folder is unreleased and may shut off, break, or
    fail at any time for any users who are not registered as a part of a
    private preview program.
  overview: |-
    The Google Cloud Storage API allows applications to read and write data
    through the abstractions of buckets and objects, which are similar to
    directories and files except that buckets cannot contain other buckets,
    and directory-level operations (like directory rename) are not supported.
    Buckets share a single global namespace, and each bucket belongs to a
    specific project that has an associated owner that pays for the data
    stored in the bucket. This API is accessed using standard gRPC requests.

# This configures the semantic version to be used in packaging this api.
#
# E.g,
#
# default: 0.9.0  # means that package manager should use 1.0.0 unless there
#                 # is a more specific version specifed
#
# For most purposes this should be sufficient, However, it may be necessary to
# have re-release the packages, so each language to specify an override.
#
# python: 0.9.1 # python had a patch release, e.g, to pick up a bugfix in grpc
# ruby: 0.10.0  # ruby had a minor release, e.g, to make available a new feature
# node: 2.0.0   # node had 2 major releases, e.g, the api changed twice

default: 0.9.0

// as follows:
//
// * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all
//   OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used
//   for output audio synthesis.
// * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
//   concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as
//   either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use
//   either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design.
// * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is
//   used for output audio synthesis.
//
// This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where
// the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard.

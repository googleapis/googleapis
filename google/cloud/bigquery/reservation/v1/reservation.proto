// This API allows users to manage their flat-rate BigQuery reservations.
//
// A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the form of
// [slots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots), to users. A slot is a
// unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the basic unit of
// parallelism. In a scan of a multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates
// on a single partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
// resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
//   `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName`.
//
// A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs
// (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. A capacity
// commitment resource exists as a child resource of the admin project and
// location, e.g.:
//   `projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id`.

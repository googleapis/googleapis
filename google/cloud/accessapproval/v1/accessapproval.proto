// This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
// Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
//
// - The API has a collection of
//   [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]
//   resources, named `approvalRequests/{approval_request}`
// - The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization, named
//   `accessApprovalSettings`
//
// The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
// Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there
// is a pending ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can
// also optionally be published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer
// (contact support if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).
//
// ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can only
// access the indicated resource or resources if the request is approved
// (subject to some exclusions:
// https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).
//
// Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be
// able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times
// may be dramatically increased. As such the SLAs do not apply to any service
// disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do
// not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
// availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
//
// After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on
// it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity
// for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an approval expires, the request
// is considered dismissed.
//
// If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.

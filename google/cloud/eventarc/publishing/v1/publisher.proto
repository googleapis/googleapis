// Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to
// a subscriber.
//
// An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
// product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
//
// A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
//
// A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
//
// A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
//
// Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
// by the subscriber in their Google Cloud project. A Channel represents a
// subscriber's intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is
// associated with exactly one event provider.
//
// ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
// is created and managed by the partner in their Google Cloud project. A
// ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
// subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
// Channel.
//
// Bus is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed in a
// Google Cloud project. A Bus provides a discoverable endpoint for events and
// is a router that receives all events published by event providers and
// delivers them to zero or more subscribers.
//
// Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.

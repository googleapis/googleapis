The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```",

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```",

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```",

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported."

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```"

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

However, if specified in both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type).

// Messages related to RequestStats, part of the Query Stats feature, that can
// help understand the performance of requests.
//
// The layout of requests below is as follows:
//   * RequestStats serves as the top-level container for statistics and
//     measures related to Bigtable requests. This common object is returned as
//     part of methods in the Data API.
//   * RequestStats contains multiple *views* of related data, chosen by an
//     option in the source Data API method. The view that is returned is
//     designed to have all submessages (and their submessages, and so on)
//     filled-in, to provide a comprehensive selection of statistics and
//     measures related to the requested view.

// ReadIterationStats captures information about the iteration of rows or cells
// over the course of a read, e.g. how many results were scanned in a read
// operation versus the results returned.
message ReadIterationStats {
  // The rows seen (scanned) as part of the request. This includes the count of
  // rows returned, as captured below.
  int64 rows_seen_count = 1;

  // The rows returned as part of the request.

  // cells returned, as captured below.

}

// RequestLatencyStats provides a measurement of the latency of the request as
// it interacts with different systems over its lifetime, e.g. how long the
// request took to execute within a frontend server.
message RequestLatencyStats {
  // The latency measured by the frontend server handling this request, from
  // when the request was received, to when this value is sent back in the
  // response. For more context on the component that is measuring this latency,
  // see: https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/overview
  //
  // Note: This value may be slightly shorter than the value reported into
  // aggregate latency metrics in Monitoring for this request
  // (https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/monitoring-instance) as this value
  // needs to be sent in the response before the latency measurement including
  // that transmission is finalized.
  //
  // Note: This value includes the end-to-end latency of contacting nodes in
  // the targeted cluster, e.g. measuring from when the first byte arrives at
  // the frontend server, to when this value is sent back as the last value in
  // the response, including any latency incurred by contacting nodes, waiting
  // for results from nodes, and finally sending results from nodes back to the
  // caller.
  google.protobuf.Duration frontend_server_latency = 1;

// FullReadStatsView captures all known information about a read.
message FullReadStatsView {
  // Iteration stats describe how efficient the read is, e.g. comparing
  // rows seen vs. rows returned or cells seen vs cells returned can provide an
  // indication of read efficiency (the higher the ratio of seen to retuned the
  // better).
  ReadIterationStats read_iteration_stats = 1;

  // Request latency stats describe the time taken to complete a request, from

  // based on the requested view.

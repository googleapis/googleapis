// Proto file describing the ShoppingPerformanceView resource.

// Shopping performance view.
//
// Provides Shopping campaign statistics aggregated at several product dimension
// levels. Product dimension values from Merchant Center such as brand,
// category, custom attributes, product condition and product type will reflect
// the state of each dimension as of the date and time when the corresponding
// event was recorded.
//
// The number of impressions and clicks that shopping_performance_view
// returns stats for may be different from campaign reports.
// shopping_performance_view shows impressions and clicks on products appearing
// in ads, while campaign reports show impressions and clicks on the ads
// themselves. Depending on the format, an ad can show from zero to several
// products, so the numbers may not match.
//
// In Google Ads UI, you can query impressions and clicks of products appearing
// in ads by selecting a column from "Product attributes" in the report editor.
// For example, selecting the "Brand" column is equivalent to selecting
// `segments.product_brand`.

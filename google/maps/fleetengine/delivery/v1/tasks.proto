// A Task in the Delivery API represents a single action to track. In general,
// there is a distinction between shipment-related Tasks and break Tasks. A
// shipment can have multiple Tasks associated with it. For example, there could
// be one Task for the pickup, and one for the drop-off or transfer. Also,
// different Tasks for a given shipment can be handled by different vehicles.
// For example, one vehicle could handle the pickup, driving the shipment to the
// hub, while another vehicle drives the same shipment from the hub to the
// drop-off location.
//
// Note: gRPC and REST APIs use different field naming conventions. For example,
// the `Task.journey_sharing_info` field in the gRPC API and the
// `DeliveryVehicle.journeySharingInfo` field in the REST API refer to the same
// field.

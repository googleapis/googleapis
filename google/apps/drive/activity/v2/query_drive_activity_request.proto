  //   - `time`: Uses numerical operators on date values either in

  //     href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339" target="_blank">RFC
  //     3339</a> format. Examples:
  //       - `time > 1452409200000 AND time <= 1492812924310`
  //       - `time >= "2016-01-10T01:02:03-05:00"`
  //
  //   - `detail.action_detail_case`: Uses the "has" operator (:) and
  //     either a singular value or a list of allowed action types enclosed in
  //     parentheses, separated by a space. To exclude a result from the
  //     response, prepend a hyphen (`-`) to the beginning of the filter string.
  //     Examples:
  //       - `detail.action_detail_case:RENAME`
  //       - `detail.action_detail_case:(CREATE RESTORE)`
  //       - `-detail.action_detail_case:MOVE`

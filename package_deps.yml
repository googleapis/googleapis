# This configures the version of the grpc and other packages 
# (e.g, the google auth library) to be used as dependencies 
# of the googleapis packages generated from the protos in
# this repo.
#
# Rationale:
# - at a given point, in any language, googleapis packages generated should depend
#   on consistent versions of their dependencies
# - the tool that creates the packages should pick up the version from a configuration file
# - it's nice to have the information all in one place to make it convenient to update
#   e.g, when new apis are added or when there is a gRPC release.

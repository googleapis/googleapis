 # Transactions
 Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
 active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
 re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
 new session for each transaction.
 # Transaction Modes
 Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
      application to retry.
   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
      transactions do not need to be committed.
 For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
 provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
 particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
 not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
 taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
 Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
 may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
 database.
 ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
 Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
 data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
 consistent.
 Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
 is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
 and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
 active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
 transaction has not been terminated by
 [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
 [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback].  Long periods of
 inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
 transaction's locks and abort it.
 Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
 being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
 have been completed.
 Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
 reads or SQL queries followed by
 [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit]. At any time before
 [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit], the client can send a
 [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] request to abort the
 transaction.
 ### Semantics
 Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
 are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
 locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
 reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
 that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
 Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
 how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
 use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
 between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
 ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
 When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
 whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
 committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
 same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
 priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
 attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
 Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
 modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
 short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
 idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
 instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
 retrying.
 ### Idle Transactions
 A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
 SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
 seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
 don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
 fail with error `ABORTED`.
 If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
 SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
 transaction from becoming idle.
 ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
 Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
 locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
 reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
 Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
 choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
 timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
 concurrent read-write transactions.
 Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
 transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
 timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
 collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
 need to worry about this in practice.
 Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
 [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
 [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] (and in fact are not
 permitted to do so).
 To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
 bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
 The types of timestamp bound are:
   - Strong (the default).
   - Bounded staleness.
   - Exact staleness.
 If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
 stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
 or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
 from the leader replica.
 Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
 ### Strong
 Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
 that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
 rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
 any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
 see the transaction.
 Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
 transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
 concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
 reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
 timestamp.
 See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong].
 ### Exact Staleness
 These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
 timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
 prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
 modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
 the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
 transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
 all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
 &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
 The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
 timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
 These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
 timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
 equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
 boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
 See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp] and
 [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness].
 ### Bounded Staleness
 Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
 subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
 newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
 of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
 All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
 the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
 transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
 reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
 different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
 Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
 negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
 read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
 timestamp.
 As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
 usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
 reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
 results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
 Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
 which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
 read-only transactions.
 See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness] and
 [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp].
 ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
 Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
 in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
 as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
 are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
 at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
 restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
 timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
 too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
